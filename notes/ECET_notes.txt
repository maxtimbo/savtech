 We will be writing a calculator in C++ by the end of the semester.

inpout == cin
output == cout

c == console

Libraries are known as "Preprocessor Directives"

"Using namespace std, "

int == intiger

int main() {

    cout << "Display Something here..." << endl;

    cout << "Blah blah " << endl;
    return 0;
}

write program to convert C to F and F to C

C to F = 9/5(c)+32

F to C = (F-32)5/9
